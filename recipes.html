    <h3>CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS</h3>
    <br></br>
    <img class="croissant2" src="images/chocolatecroissant.webp" alt="Chocolate croissants">
    <br></br>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b>:
        <li>4 cups flour (500 g)</li>
        <li>½ cup water (120 mL)</li>
        <li>½ cup milk (120 mL)</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar (50 g)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 packet instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups cold unsalted butter (285 g), cut into ½-inch (1 cm) thick slices</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 bars sweetened chocolate bar</li>
    </p>
<p><b>Recipe</b>:
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, water, milk, sugar, salt, yeast, and butter. Once the dough starts to clump, turn it out onto a clean counter.</li>
        <li>Lightly knead the dough and form it into a ball, making sure not to over-knead it. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Slice the cold butter in thirds and place it onto a sheet of parchment paper. Place another piece of parchment on top of the butter, and beat it with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Keeping the parchment paper on the butter, use a rolling pin to roll the butter into a 7-inch (18 cm) square, ½-inch (1 cm) thick. If necessary, use a knife to trim the edges and place the trimmings back on top of the butter and continue to roll into a square. </li>
        <li>Transfer the butter layer to the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>To roll out the dough, lightly flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter, and push the rolling pin once vertically into the dough and once horizontally to form four quadrants.</li>
        <li>Roll out each corner and form a 10-inch (25 cm) square.</li>
        <li>Place the butter layer on top of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter, enclosing it completely.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough with a rolling pin to seal the seams, making sure to lengthen the dough, rather than widening it.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s 8x24 inches (20x61 cm).</li>
        <li>Fold the top half down to the middle, and brush off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom half over the top and turn the dough clockwise to the left. This completes the first turn.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough again two more times, completing three turns in total and refrigerating for 1 hour in between each turn. If at anytime the dough or butter begins to soften, stop and transfer back to the fridge.</li>
        <li>After the final turn, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>To form the croissants, cut the dough in half. Place one half in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Flour the surface and roll out the dough into a long narrow strip, about 8x40 inches (20x101 cm).</li>
        <li>With a knife, trim the edges of the dough.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into 4 rectangles.</li>
        <li>Place the chocolate on the edge of the dough and roll tightly enclosing it in the dough.</li>
        <li>Place the croissants on a baking sheet, seam side down.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the other half of the dough.</li>
        <li>Brush the croissants with the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg wash in the fridge for later.</li>
        <li>Place the croissants in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Once the croissants have proofed, brush them with one more layer of egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>PIZZA</h3>
<br></br>
<img class="pizza2" src="images/pizzabuns.jpg" alt="Pizza buns">
<br></br>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b>:
        <li>2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour    
        <li>1 Tbsp vegetable, canola or other neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups pizza sauce (make your own or a good store-bought)</li>
        <li>3 cups sharp cheddar cheese shredded</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp instant yeast or bread machine or rapid rise yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water quite warm - 120-130° F.</li>
    </p>
<p><b>Recipe</b>:
    <ol>
        <li>For the dough: In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the kneading hook, mix together 2  cups of the flour, the sugar, salt and instant yeast. In a measuring cup, combine the warm water with the oil. Add the water mixture to the dry ingredients and mix to combine. Knead by hand or with the mixer, add more flour in small increments, as needed, until the dough comes together into a smooth dough. It shouldn't stick to your hands or be dry and crumbly. Grease a bowl and place the dough ball into the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 30 - 45 minutes, depending on how warm your kitchen is.</li>
        <li>Prepare two baking sheets by lining each with a sheet of parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough to a floured cutting board. Cut the dough evenly in half. Cut each half in half again. Cut each piece in half again and then in half again, to make a total of 16 roughly equal sized pieces. </li>
        <li>Take a piece of dough. Form it in to a rough ball, then stretch in to a circle about 4-5 inches in diameter. (You don't need to stretch them completely at this point. Once the dough has rested a few minutes on the baking sheet, they will be easier to shape, so you will be going back and stretching them out a second time later.) Place the dough circle onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with each piece of dough, placing 8 on each on the prepared sheets (you can place them fairly close together as they don't spread much, but don't allow them to actually touch each other). Go back to the first pieces you formed and stretch them a little more, as needed.</li>
        <li>With all your rolled dough on the baking sheets, using a teaspoon from your cutlery drawer, top each piece of dough with two heaping teaspoon of pizza sauce, spreading it over the top, going as far to the edges as you can without it going over the sides. Top with a generous amount of shredded cheddar cheese. Repeat with all the buns. Let stand 20 minutes, while you preheat the oven.</li>
        <li>With racks in the upper and lower third of your oven, preheat oven to 375° F. with the rack in the centre of the oven. After buns have stood for 20 minutes or so (or until they look a little puffy around the outside edges), bake in preheated for 20-25 minutes , switching the pans from top to bottom half way through baking. Cook until well browned. Remove from oven and allow to cool on baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack to cool completely. Enjoy immediately or cover and refrigerate. Or see below for freezing instructions!</li>
        <li>Freezing: These buns freeze really well. Freeze them on baking sheet and then transfer to a freezer bag. To enjoy straight from the freezer, no need to thaw. Just place the frozen buns on a baking sheet and warm in a preheated 400° oven for 7 or 8 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>PRETZEL BREAD BUNS</h3>
<br></br>
<img class="pretzel2" src="images/pretzelrolls.jpg" alr="Prezel bread buns with salt">
<br></br>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b>:
        <li>3 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon flour (preferably white spelt or unbleached wheat)</li>
        <li>1 1/4-ounce envelope fact-acting yeast</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups water, lukewarm</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons baking soda, for the alkaline solution</li>
        <li>coarse sea salt</li>
    </p>
<p><b>Recipe</b>:
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the water and butter — the mixture should be luke­warm. Add to the flour mixture and mix with the dough hooks of an electric mixer for a few minutes or until well combined. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour. Transfer the dough to a work surface and continue kneading and punching it down with your hands for a few minutes until you have a smooth and elastic ball of dough. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a tea towel, and let rise in a warm place, or preferably in a 100°F (35°C) warm oven, for 60 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>When the dough has doubled in size, punch it down, take it out of the bowl, and knead for about 30 seconds. Divide the dough into 10 equal (roughly 3-ounce) portions. Dust your hands with flour, lay a portion of dough on the palm of one hand, and with the other hand forming a dome over the dough, roll it for about 10 seconds until its top is round and firm. This process creates surface tension and prevents the buns from becoming flat. Continue with the remaining dough, then cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm place for about 20 minutes or until puffy.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, wide enough to fit 2 buns at once, bring 4¼ cups of water and the baking soda to a boil. Watch the pot; the baking soda-water mixture will foam up. With a slotted ladle or spoon, slip two buns gently into the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds, turn them over, and cook for another 30 seconds. The buns don’t need to be completely covered with the solution, but mind that they don’t stick to the bottom. Transfer the buns to the lined baking sheets, score a cross on the buns, and sprinkle with coarse sea salt.</li>
        <li>Cook the remaining buns in the same manner, then bake, one sheet at a time, for about 16 minutes or until golden brown. Enjoy warm with unsalted butter.</li>

<h3>PORK SKEWERS</h3>
<br></br>
<img class="mooping2" src="images/mooping.jpg" alt="Moo ping or pork skewers">
<br></br>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b>:
        <li>4 medium garlic cloves (20g), minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (15g) minced cilantro stems, plus fresh cilantro leaves for serving</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (30g) finely chopped palm sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) oyster sauce</li>
                                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (6g) ground white pepper</li>
                                    <li>1/2 teaspoon (2g) MSG powder (optional)</li>
                                        <li>2 pounds (900g) pork butt, in one piece</li>
                                            <li>1 (5 1/2-ounce; 160ml) can unsweetened coconut cream</li>
    </p>
<p><b>Recipe</b>:
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine garlic, cilantro stems, palm sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper, and MSG (if using), and stir until palm sugar is dissolved. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Freeze pork for 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes (partially freezing the pork makes it easier to slice). Using a sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice pork against the grain into 2-inch-long, 1-inch-wide, and 1/8-inch-thick strips. The easiest and most efficient way to do this is to start by portioning the pork butt into 2-inch-wide by 1-inch-thick pieces, and then slicing those pieces crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick strips.</li>
                <li>Combine pork and marinade in a large bowl, and, using hands, toss until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to 36 hours.</li>
                    <li>Thread one piece of pork onto a skewer, piercing it through twice to secure it, then bunching meat tightly together like an accordion. Continue threading pork onto skewer, making sure meat is tightly bunched together, leaving no parts of the skewer exposed except for a 2-inch handle at the bottom, and the pointy tip at the top. Repeat skewering process with remaining pork.</li>
                        <li>Set up grill for skewers, making sure to adjust distance between bricks to the length of your skewers. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly in the channel between the bricks.</li>
                            <li>Place skewers directly over the hot coals, balancing them on top of the bricks, with the handles overhanging the bricks closest to you and the tips balancing on the farther wall of bricks. Using a brush, brush pork with coconut cream. Cook, turning skewers and brushing pork with coconut cream frequently, until meat is lightly charred, and a piece of pork looks cooked through when removed and cut in half, 8 to 10 minutes; if flare-ups occur, move the skewers around as needed to get them away from the flames. Transfer to serving platter and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately, passing lime wedges, as well as cilantro and dipping sauce (if using), at the table.</li>
